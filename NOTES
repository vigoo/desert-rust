For the blog:

- Define BinaryInput and BinaryOutput
- How we define BinarySerializer and BinaryDeserializer, what's the serialization context trait
- Show how we can implement it for a few types.
- We cannot do specialization: introduce the cast! macro (castaway crate)
- feature dependent modules
- How can we store arbitrary data in the "refs" support? StorableRef, dyn_eq and dyn_hash crates
- we cannot do a usable fields_default map so we pass the values one by one from the macro-generated serializers. same for transients
- the v vs v0 trick and why we need to decide from the outside
- The derivation macro
  - converting the evolution attribute into static data
  - generating code based on the type's shape
- Testing: proptest
